# LSE_DA_NHS_Analysis

## Context
This GitHub repo contains material that describes the approach and findings regarding a data analysis study on General Practitioner (GP) appointments with the National Health Services (NHS). NHS is a publicly funded healthcare system in England and incurs significant, potentially avoidable costs, when patients miss GP appointments. 

Therefore, the primary objective is to get a better understanding on the reasons of why patients miss GP appointments. This study is a preliminary investigation into this issue the main outcomes will be to identify areas for further research to fully achieve the key objective. 

This report supports NHS’s objective by answering the following key questions:
-	What are the basic characteristics of the data set provided by the NHS?
-	What monthly and seasonal trends in appointment numbers and categories are evident from the data?
-	What sentiments can be found on Twitter related to healthcare in the UK?
-	Have the NHS been sufficiently staffed to handle demand for appointments?
-	Is there any visible trend in the amount of missed NHS appointments?

## Findings from analysis <br>
The aim of this study was to set the foundation to achieve the NHS’s primary objective: understanding the reasons of why patients miss GP appointments. 

Through this initial analysis, several key findings have been observed in the data set provided:
-	There are heavy seasonal peaks in the total number of appointments scheduled with the NHS. 
-	Peaks in the number of non-attended visits show a similar trend as the total scheduled appointments, but the non-attended visits relative to the total appointments is relatively stable.
-	Sentiment analysis through Twitter emphasizes the importance of taking the context of the global COVID19 pandemic into account. Peaks could coincide with vaccination rounds, COVID outbreaks, (end of) lockdowns, and other non-regular events.
-	Utilization rates of NHS capacity fluctuate with the peaks in demand, but never reach 100% or higher. However, it is unclear whether the provided capacity figures provide an accurate picture of the situation on the ground. Taking into account the context of the global pandemic (and evidenced by several Twitter themes), it is likely that the true capacity of the NHS actually decreased during peak demand, as health workers were at increased risk of catching the COVID19 virus. This requires more research.

In any case, it is clear from the analysis that there are large swings in the demand for various NHS services across the year. While a longer time horizon is needed to fully understand the long-term trends (especially in a post-pandemic society), it is advised that the NHS approaches planning with a flexible lens: there is no one-size-fits-all approach to setting up services. Scalability to adjust to seasonal peaks is key in responding to patient demand, and if seasonal trends are found to be recurring over the years, can be planned for in advance.
Areas for further exploration
This study uncovered some of the basic characteristics of the NHS appointments, their characteristics and several trend figures over the explored time period. Further research is recommended to fully answer the NHS key objective of understanding the reasons behind not attended GP appointments:

-	A more detailed breakdown into the actual capacity of the NHS (including staff availability) would help understand the true capacity figures and the strain on resources.
-	Contextual data that plot the NHS data against societal events, especially related to the COVID19 pandemic, would help explore further to what extent external factors play a role in attendance of GP visits. It’s not hard to imagine that patients testing positive for COVID19 would cancel their face-to-face appointment.
-	In the long term, a patient/GP survey would greatly simplify the analysis work as well. With the large scope of the NHS, the expectation is that it would be relatively easy to gather large amounts of data in a short time.
